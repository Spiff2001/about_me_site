    <p> one of my main interests is hobbyist engineering and coding. Working with some 3d printing software and online diagrams, I made a rechargeable bluetooth speaker! </p>
    <img src="canyon.jpeg" alt="a view from the top of the Angel's Landing hike at Zion national park" style="width: 500 px; height: 400px; ">
    <p> I also enjoy the outdoors, whether at home or on trips. Here is the view from the top of Angel's Landing at Zion National Park! </p>
    <img src="confection.JPG" alt="a key-lime pie that I made a while back; the top is covered in whipped cream and decorated with candied limes" style="width: 500 px; height: 400px; ">
    <p> I have a bit of a sweet tooth, and whenever I can I like to bake all sorts of confections, from pies, to cakes, to lamingtons, and beyond. </p>
